# Lab_9
 in this lab i used data from unsplash.com, first i fetch the topic from their data using ajax and then put push it into button form. Next after the topic function was called, when i click into each button that contain the topic, it will call the second function which fetch to show images that compatible with the chosen topic.
 I also added some hover and popup effect to make the gallery looks smoother.
